      <name>Basic Pitch Histogram</name>
      <description>A feature vector consisting of bin magnitudes of the basic pitch histogram described in the jSymbolic manual. Each bin corresponds to one of the 128 MIDI pitches, ordered from lowest to highest, and with an interval of a semitone between each (enharmonic equivalents are assigned the same pitch number). Bin 60 corresponds to middle C. The magnitude of of each bin is proportional to the the number of times notes occurred at the bin's pitch in the piece, relative to all other pitches in the piece (the histogram is normalized).</description>

      <name>Chord Type Histogram</name>
      <description>A feature vector consisting of bin magnitudes of the chord type histogram described in the jSymbolic manual. This is a normalized histogram that has bins labeled with types of chords (in the following order and with the indicated identifying codes): partial chords consisting of just two pitch classes [0], minor triads [1], major triads [2], diminished triads [3], augmented triads [4], other triads [5], minor seventh chords [6], dominant seventh chords [7], major seventh chords [8], other chords consisting of four pitch classes [9], and complex chords with more than four pitch classes [10]. The bin magnitudes are calculated by going through MIDI ticks one by one and incrementing the counter for the bin that corresponds to the chord, if any, that is present during eah given tick; the result is that the chords in this histogram are weighted by the duration with which each chord is played. All inversions are treated as equivalent and octave doubling is ignored in the calculation of this histogram. Melodic behaviour is not considered, so arpeggios are not counted in this histogram.</description>

   <feature>
      <name>Rhythmic Value Histogram</name>
      <description>A feature vector, representing a normalized histogram where the value of each bin specifies the fraction of all notes in the music with a rhythmic value corresponding to that of the given bin. The bins are numbered as follows: thirty second notes (or less) [0], sixteenth notes [1], eighth notes [2], dotted eighth notes [3], quarter notes [4], dotted quarter notes [5], half notes [6], dotted half notes [7], whole notes [8], dotted whole notes [9], double whole notes [10] and dotted double whole notes (or more ) [11]. Both pitched and unpitched notes are included in this histogram. Tempo is, of course, not relevant to this histogram. Notes with durations not precisely matching one of these rhythmic note values are mapped to the closest note value (to filter out the effects of rubato or uneven human rhythmic performances, for example). This histogram is calculated without regard to the dynamics, voice or instrument of any given note.</description>

This calculation includes both pitched and unpitched notes, is calculated after rhythmic quantization, is not influenced by tempo, and is calculated without regard to the dynamics, voice or instrument of any given note.</description>
